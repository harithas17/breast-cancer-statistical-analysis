# Breast Cancer Statistical Analysis

This project investigates whether three diagnostic features (radius, texture, and smoothness) differ significantly between malignant and benign breast tumors.

## Tools Used
- SAS Studio
- PowerBI
- UCI Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset
- Statistical methods: Normality Test, t-test, Kruskal–Wallis

## Key Findings
- All three features show statistically significant differences
- Radius is the strongest indicator of malignancy
- Results were consistent across parametric and non-parametric tests
